        <p>
          GitHub is a web-based interface for version control, a way of keeping track of changes made to a collection of working documents. GitHub provides a structure and space for communicating about collaborative work on open projects.
        </p>
        <p>
          This exercise walks you through adding your very first contribution to an open source collaborative project using Git/Github through the GitHub web interface.
        </p>

        <h3>The Brief</h3>

        <p>
          We want to know who's taking part in the workshop, so please add your name to the <a href=https://github.com/KirstieJane/friendly-github-intro/blob/master/humans.md>humans.md</a> file in the <a href=https://github.com/KirstieJane/friendly-github-intro/>friendly-github-intro</a> workshop repository.
        </p>
        <p>
          You'll have to <strong>fork the repo</strong>, make a change to the <strong>humans.md</strong> file and <strong>commit</strong> it to your fork, and then make a <strong>pull request</strong> to ask the workshop facilitator to merge the edit.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you have time, <strong>make an issue</strong> in your own repository suggesting a change that someone else could make and add a link to that issue to the <a href=https://github.com/KirstieJane/friendly-github-intro/issues/3>participant issue list</a> issue in the <a href=https://github.com/KirstieJane/friendly-github-intro/>friendly-github-intro</a> workshop repository. Then, either sit back and wait for someone to make that change for you, or go and see if you can help someone else move their project along.
        </p>

                    If you see the error below, you're trying to <strong>edit the original version</strong> of the repository, not your own fork!

                    Go back to your home page by clicking on your avatar in the top right corner, click on your profiles, and you should see <strong>your own fork</strong> of the repository there!

          <h2 id="stretch-goal">Stretch goal: Pull requests for other projects</h2>
          <p>
            Try asking other members of the workshop to help you. Create a new issue and add a link to the <a href=https://github.com/KirstieJane/friendly-github-intro/issues/3>participant issue list</a> issue in the <a href=https://github.com/KirstieJane/friendly-github-intro/>friendly-github-intro</a> workshop repository. Then, while you wait for another participant to help you fix the issue, take a look to see if there are any you can help with.
          </p>
    
          <p>
            Use the <strong>social features</strong> of GitHub as much as you can. If the issue isn't clear, <strong>ask</strong> for clarification. Be polite and as clear as possible whether you're the project owner or the contributor.
          </p>
    
          <p>
            Remember that to make a contribution to someone else's project you'll have to <strong>fork</strong> their repository so you have your own copy. Check <a href=https://kirstiejane.github.io/friendly-github-intro/exercises/my-first-pullrequest/>my first pull request</a> exercise if you need any help with those steps.
