# Introduction

GitHub is a web-based interface for version control, a way of keeping track of changes made to a collection of working documents. GitHub provides a structure and space for communicating about collaborative work on open projects.

This exercise walks you through adding your very first contribution to an open source collaborative project using Git/Github through the GitHub web interface.

## The Brief

We want to know who's taking part in the workshop, so please add your name to the humans.md file in the friendly-github-intro workshop repository.

You'll have to **fork the repo**, make a change to the [humans.md](https://github.com/KirstieJane/friendly-github-intro/blob/gh-pages/humans.md) file and **commit** it to your fork, and then make a **pull request** to ask the workshop facilitator to merge the edit.

# My first pull request: Step by step

  4. Find & open the [humans.md](https://github.com/KirstieJane/friendly-github-intro/blob/gh-pages/humans.md)  file

    You're going to add your name to the [humans.md](https://github.com/KirstieJane/friendly-github-intro/blob/gh-pages/humans.md)  file that lists all the contributors to this project.

    **HEADS UP: Common mistake!**

    If you see the error below, you're trying to edit the original version of the repository, not your own fork! Go back to your home page by clicking on your avatar in the top right corner, click on your profiles, and you should see your own fork of the repository there!

  5. Make a change & save the commit

     Change some of the information for one of the test participants to your own details. You might find this [handy markdown guide](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet) helpful.

  6. Make a pull request

      Now you're ready to ask the project owner to merge in your changes.

      Click on the Pull Request tab and then on New Pull Request.

  7. Wait for your pull request to be merged

      Keep an eye on your notifications to see if the project owner has any questions.

      If you've made a mistake, you might be asked to make further changes (but hopefully not!)

If all goes well, CONGRATULATIONS! You've just made your first pull request and worked collaboratively on GitHub!
