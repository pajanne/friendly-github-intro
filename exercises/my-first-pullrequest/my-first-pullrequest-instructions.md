# Introduction

GitHub is a web-based interface for version control, a way of keeping track of changes made to a collection of working documents. GitHub provides a structure and space for communicating about collaborative work on open projects.

This exercise walks you through adding your very first contribution to an open source collaborative project using Git/Github through the GitHub web interface.

## The Brief

You're going to add a sentence to a file in your partner's repository. It doesn't matter what you say! You can add anything you want.

You'll have to **fork the repo**, **make a change** to a file (probably the README file), **commit** the change to your fork, and then make a **pull request** to ask your partner to merge the edit.

Then **switch roles** and repeat! The contributor becomes the project owner and vice versa.

# My first pull request: Step by step

  1. Find the repo

  In the screenshots we're going to follow Kirstie's Secret account making changes to the [friendly-github-intro]((https://github.com/KirstieJane/friendly-github-intro)) repository.

  When you work with your partner, you should to go to your partner's repository link and edit one of the files there (probably the README.md file).

  2. Sign in

      Log into your github account.

  3. Fork the Repo

    Make a copy of the repository all of your own.

    <img src="../../assets/images-slides/my-first-pr-fork2.png" width="80%" />

  4. Find & open the file you want to edit

     In the example below, Kirstie (Secret) is going to add her name to the humans.md file.

     You should make whatever change you want in your fork of your partner's repository.

    <img src="../../assets/images-slides/my-first-pr-humans2.png" width="80%" />

    **HEADS UP: Common mistake!**

    If you see the error below, you're trying to edit the original version of the repository, not your own fork! Go back to your home page by clicking on your avatar in the top right corner, click on your profiles, and you should see your own fork of the repository there!

  5. Make a change & save the commit

     Change some of the information in the file. You might find this [handy markdown guide](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet) helpful.

  6. Make a pull request

      Now you're ready to ask the project owner to merge in your changes.

      Click on the Pull Request tab and then on New Pull Request.

      <img src="../../assets/images-slides/my-first-pr-new-pr2.png" width="80%" />

  7. Wait for your pull request to be merged

      Keep an eye on your notifications to see if the project owner has any questions.

      If you've made a mistake, you might be asked to make further changes (but hopefully not!)

If all goes well, CONGRATULATIONS! You've just made your first pull request and worked collaboratively on GitHub!
