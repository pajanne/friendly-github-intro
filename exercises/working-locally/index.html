        <p>
          GitHub is a web-based interface for version control, a way of keeping track of changes made to a collection of working documents. GitHub provides a structure and space for communicating about collaborative work on open projects.
        </p>
        <p>
          This exercise walks you through adding a local project from your own computer to GitHub using the <a href=http://desktop.github.com>GitHub Desktop application</a>. You'll learn how to make changes to your files locally and <strong>push</strong> those changes back to GitHub. You'll also <strong>revert</strong> a commit so you know how to roll back a change you want to undo.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you'd rather use one of these <strong>example repositories</strong> you're very welcome to. Just click on the link below and save the files to your computer.

        <h3>The Brief</h3>

        <p>
          Add a new project from your own computer to GitHub. Edit one of the files, or a add a new one, and <strong>commit</strong> your change. <strong>Push</strong> that change to GitHub. Finally, try to undo that change to <strong>revert</strong> to a previous version of the repository.

                   If you have a project you want to put on GitHub, that's great! If not, you are welcome to use some projects we've prepared for you (see: <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/1xtfj3sbyzkmjge/chocolate-chip-cookies.zip?dl=1" target="blank">Chocolate Chip Cookie Recipe</a>, <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/wcy6w7nptkjdyz1/interactive-r-map.zip?dl=1" target="blank">Interactive R map</a>, <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/u2gglh48mq6pakq/portfolio-template.zip?dl=1" target="blank">Web Portfolio Template</a>, <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/l124lqi40oqdg8m/writing-sample.zip?dl=1">Writing Sample - UBC Dissertation</a>.)

                <h1>Add your project to GitHub</h1>
                <h3><b>First: Click the "+" button</b></h3>
                <img src="../../assets/images-slides/github-desktop-ui-add.png">

                <p><b>Fifth: Commit and Publish</b> Now that you've created a git repository from your folder, you can now commit each of your files.</h3>
                <h3>You can either commit all of the files at once and in the commit message say:
                <code><pre>
Initial Commit
                </pre></code>
                <br>
                or you can individually commit each file by selecting each file by the check boxes and writing a separate commit message for each file.
                </p>

                <p>here is a video showing this process</p>

            </li>
            <li>
                <h1>Create a branch, make changes, merge them in</h1>

                <p>In this step, make a branch to work on some new content for your newly added repo, make a commit, and merge those changes from your new branch into your master branch. </p>
                <iframe width="720" height="600" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/zgxaNRA7e1Q" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
                <br>
                <br>
                  <p>For the example of the writing sample, a new branch ("new-title") is created to add a new title to the thesis. A new title is added and the file is committed to the new branch called "new-title".</p>

                <p>After making the changes, we decide that the master branch needs to have this same title, SO, we:
                 </p>
                 <ul>
                    <li>- toggle back to the master branch</li>
                    <li>- click the "compare" button and select the "new-title" branch.</li>
                    <li>- "update from 'new-title' " which merges those changes in.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Last, we check the file to see if the changes have been merged from the "new-title" branch to the "master" branch.</p>

                <h3>A Note on switching back and forth between branches</h3>
                <p>Notice when we switch back and forth between branches how the title is different. While it appears that "thesis.doc" is the same file, Git is running in the background to make sure that the changes you applied are properly applied based on which branch you're in.</p>

            </li>
            <li>
                <h1> Revert a commit</h1>
                <p>
                   The last piece of functionality we will try is to revert a commit. In a situation in which you are not happy with a commit, you can "revert" the commit by:
                </p>

                <h3>First: click on the commit you want to revert</h2>
                <img src="../../assets/images-slides/revert-1.png">

                <h3>Second: click the "gear icon" and "revert this commit" ... then sync!</h2>
