## Questions/feedback from the workshop

- Three different ways to merge a pull request online: [merge, squash and rebase](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2427238/in-git-what-is-the-difference-between-merge-squash-and-rebase)
- [Pull request on command line](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4037928/can-you-issue-pull-requests-from-the-command-line-on-github)
- Add git pull from command line slide
- Text editor: add info and link to Atom, otherwise the default editor on mac is TextEdit
- Clarify where are the uncommitted changes in GitHub Desktop
- Explain the differences between subversion and GitHub, when you commit with GitHub you’re not done, you still have to push!
- GitHub Desktop is confusing, will be better to use the command line…
- Have drawing/pictures of each workflow for the exercises
- Make clear when opening the project folder, it opens it with the branch showed in the GitHub Desktop!
- Command line to check which branch you are on: git branch
- Revert vs reset? What is the difference.
- Git flow: https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/
- Talk about private repositories


# Feedback from the workshop on July 22nd, 2016

## Questions/feedback from the workshop

- Why we have a README.md file? Explanation needs to be given earlier on why it is important to have this file.
- Empty repo with no file. When creating a repo online, it is important to not forget to tick the box next to the README file otherwise the repo will be empty.
- What blame means?
- Pull request not explain!
- Conflict needs to be explained too...
- Branch name and repo need to be unique
- Exercise2 does not work. everyone editing same file issue with conflicts. Conflict cannot be solved online, only from the command line.
- Exercise3. Desktop client add from local does not work on windows when setups are not done correctly. Need to be checked before to be able to help better windows users.

## Actions

- Get explanation on how to create **academic account** with free private repos. https://education.github.com/discount_requests/new
- Changes made in master file cannot be pulled requested into branch without swapping base/compare branches!
- Conflict appears between branch and master if changes are not committed.

## Lessons learnt

- **Post-it session**: only two questions for 2 post-it per person
- **Introduction presentation**: change presentation to include explanation of Pull Request as well as the workflow form exercise ‘My first repo'
- **‘My first pull request’ exercise** change it to work in pair and let people request each others (show how to find someone else account on github.com)
- Test **desktop client on windows** to see where are the settings in order to be able to add a repo from a folder
- Improve workflow explanation for each of the exercises upfront
- Green post-it works very well but do not forget to ask them to remove it at the end of each exercise sessions
- GitHub Desktop App. Show differences between app and online actions for same workflow.
- Show workflow of changes in three different way: online, app and command line.

## Possible new flow for next workshop

1. **Introduction.** Create repo/Add file/Commit changes online
2. **Desktop App.** same actions as done online, Create repo/Add file/Commit changes as well as how to do so on the command line
2. **Collaboration.** Then introduce branching/pull request/fork and the collaborative work. Work by pair.
