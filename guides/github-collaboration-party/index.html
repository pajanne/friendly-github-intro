        <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
        <p>GitHub is a web-based interface for version control, a way of keeping track of changes made to a collection of working documents. GitHub provides a structure and space for communicating about collaborative work on open projects. <strong> With bit of set-up, and a good workflow, you can make your project accessible and transparent, and create a respectful and productive working environment for your collaborators.</strong></p>
        <p>This exercise walks you through a collaborative workflow for using Git/Github through the GitHub web interface. </p>
        <h3>The Brief</h3>
        <p>You notice online someone is planning a party, but clearly lack any direction for how to make this party <em>off the hook</em>. Because you want this party to be <em>da bomb</em> you decide you're going to contribute some help based on the issues that this person has posted in their repo. </p>
        <p>You know that since you don't know this person, you'll have to <b>comment on the issue of interest to let them know what you're working on</b>, <b>fork their repo</b>, make changes and commit them to your fork, and then make a pull request to show the party planner your contributions. </p>

        <h2 id="steps-to-complete-1">GitHub Online: Steps to Complete</h2>
        <ol class="steps">
            <!-- Step 0 -->
            <li>
                <h1>Find the repo & read the contributing.md</h1>
                <p>
                    You are browsing the interwebz and realize that this poor soul needs help planning a party. You feel compelled to contribute and decide the best thing to do is read through the contributing.md file to see how you could best contribute - this person seems like they need a lot of help.

            <li>
                <h1>Comment on the issue you want to work on</h1>
                <p>
                    <strong>As contributor:</strong>It is always a good idea to start a conversation with the owner of the repo so they know who is doing what and why.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>As repo owner:</strong> make sure to be responsive when people are willing to help out. Be sure to express your appreciation and offer any guidance.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h1>Fork the Repo</h1>
                <p>
                    <strong>As contributor:</strong> fork the repo.

                <h1>Create a branch</h1>
                <p>
                    <strong>As contributor:</strong> It is always good practice to create a branch from the project so that you can leave the "master" branch in tact while you add new content or functionality.
                </p>

                <h1>Make a pull request</h1>
                <p><strong>As contributor:</strong> make a pull request to ask the project owner to review your contribution. You will have to comment on the pull request before submitting your pull request. </p>

                <p><strong>As repo owner:</strong> review the pull request, comment on the pull request, and provide feedback. If it looks good, then merge the pull request!</p>
